# Angular Frontend reaching out to Laravel API backend

A project showing how to create a frontend using Angular. Basically this Single Page Application (SPA) reaches out to a Laravel API backend. For authentication we are using **JWT** to fetch tokens fro the backend. Feel free to customize the SPA and add some frontend validation.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## API backend
* Laravel backend - [Download code here](https://github.com/Patwan/restful-api-backend-laravel)
